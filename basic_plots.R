# Basic Plots

# Load the datasets and define some variables
library(dslabs)
data(murders)

#1. Scatterplots 
population_in_millions <- murders$population/10^6
total_gun_murders <- murders$total
plot(population_in_millions, total_gun_murders)
# Transform population using the log10 transformation and save to object log10_population
log10_population <- log10(murders$population)
# Transform total gun murders using log10 transformation and save to object log10_total_gun_murders
log10_total_gun_murders <- log10(murders$total)
# Create a scatterplot with the log scale transformed population and murders 
plot(log10_population, log10_total_gun_murders)

#2. Histograms 
# Store the population in millions and save to population_in_millions 
population_in_millions <- murders$population/10^6
# Create a histogram of this variable
hist(population_in_millions)

#3. Boxplots 
# Create a boxplot of state populations by region for the murders dataset
boxplot(population ~ region, data = murders)
